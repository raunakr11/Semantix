Project Title: Ambulance Alert System

Project Domain: 
Web Development

Abstract:
Our project aims to free up the upcoming route which an ambulance will follow by sending alerts to the drivers on the route to avoid ambulances getting stuck in traffic jams.

Introduction:
According to Times of India about 146,133 people were killed in road accidents in India in the year 2016. Out of these about 30% of deaths are caused due to delayed ambulance. Another Indian government data shows more than 50% of heart attack cases reach hospital late, which can constitute unavailability of ambulances too but majority of it is due to patients stuck in traffic. Our aim is to send alerts to drivers to make way well before time to avoid traffic jams.

Approach
Our solution consists of sending alerts to the drivers who are on the route of the ambulance. These alerts will be similar to the ones that are sent to citizens of Japan before an earthquake occurs. The hospital can share the ambulance route with the service providers (Airtel, Jio, etc). Taking information from the towers of the respective service providers, an alert will be sent to the appropriate user on the route and they can adjust themselves to allow an ambulance to pass by.
To show the functionality of this, we made a program where we collect the user’s(driver’s) number . The user’s live location will be traced and if the user lies on the ambulance’s route(preset), he will be sent a WhatsApp message (imitating an alert) to make way for an upcoming ambulance.


Advantages of your Solution 
The current solution for this is hoping that the ambulance goes through a route where the traffic jam has been broken or not being formed yet. 
Our approach makes sure that all drivers on the route are well informed and hence they know not to rush (or to rush) to avoid traffic jams


Pitfalls of your Solution 
Not all users on the route carry their mobile devices with them at all time while travelling. This can cause some users to not follow what is going on. Hopefully they will align themselves with the users who are making way for an ambulance.

Future Scope 
We would implement machine learning into this as it will help us predict routes of users and tell them to make way or tell the ambulance an alternate way, etc.
